# Face-Detection-Project
This project uses the OpenCV library to detect faces in a live stream from webcam or in a video file stored in the local machine. it detects faces in real time and tracks it. It uses pre-trained XML classifiers for the same. The classifiers used in this program have facial features trained in them. Different classifiers can be used to detect different objects.
